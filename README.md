#  Requirements üßê

<img src="./rqms.png" height="100">

I cannot find anywhere simple requirements management tool for my project, so I decided to write one.
This project currently is used for research how `homebrew` distribution works, but maybe this tool will be usable in production some day üòÑ

Current status üí°

1Ô∏è‚É£ ‚úÖ parsing swift source code

2Ô∏è‚É£ ‚úÖ parsing `reqfile`

3Ô∏è‚É£ ‚úÖ requiments fullfillment raport printed into standard output

4Ô∏è‚É£ ‚úÖ  distribute this tool by homebrew

5Ô∏è‚É£ ‚úÖ  generate nicely formatted raport file (HTML, Markdown)


## How it works?

You need
- file named `reqfile` with listed all requirements with following format
```
[RQ:requirement_id1:requirement_short_description]
[RQ:requirement_id2:requirement_short_description2]
```
- `.swift` files with source code.
- `Requirements` built version

Let's assume that your app has a lot of requirements (for example. when the user don't interact with app for 3 minutes, app must force log-out).
How to not forget about them? üßê
List them into one place, assign some id, and when you fullfill some requirement  in your app implementation, just place comment with this requirement üòÑ
This tool is created for automated process of checking, which requirements are fullfilled, and which aren't.

## Example:

`reqfile`
```
[RQ:app_force_logout:The app must force logout user after 5 minutes]
```

`LoginSessionManager.swift`
```swift

class LoginSessionManager {

    // [RQ:app_force_logout:force logout user]
    func checkTime(){
        if currentSessionTime > TimeInterval.minutes * 3 {
            forceLogout()
        }
    }
    
    //... Any other code which is required here üòÖ
}
```

Following command
```
./Requirements path-to-the-directory-with-swift-files path-to-the-reqfile path-to-the-directory-for-report-file
```

will produce the following output in the terminal
```
Fullfilled requirements
Requirement(id: "app_force_logout", description: "The app must force logout user after 5 minutes")
Not fullfilled requirements
Empty
Unknown requirements
Empty
Program ended with exit code: 0
```

and generate following markdown file
```
# Requirements! üßê

| ID             | State | Description             |
| -------------- | ----- | ----------------------- |
| app_force_logout    | ‚úÖ     | The app must force logout user after 5 minutes |

Fullfillment percentage 100.0%
